# Lessons from my First Unity Project

Back at university, I was part of the Gaming Development Club. It was a fantastic experience that taught me more about practical software engineering than any single class.

We decided to build a simple 2D platformer. Here are a few things I learned:

1.  **Scope Creep is Real:** Our "simple" game quickly ballooned with new feature ideas. Learning to cut features is harder, and more important, than learning to add them.
2.  **The Physics Engine is Your Friend (and Enemy):** Relying on Unity's built-in physics is a huge time-saver. Fighting it (by trying to manually override gravity or collisions) is a recipe for bugs.
3.  **Game Dev is 90% Polish:** Getting the character to jump is easy. Making the jump "feel" right takes days of tweaking gravity, jump height, and coyote time.
