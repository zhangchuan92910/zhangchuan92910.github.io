# A Guide to Vancouver's Best Ramen

As a long-time resident, I've tried my fair share of ramen in Vancouver (and Richmond). Here are my personal, highly opinionated rankings.

### The Top Tier

1.  **Ramen Danbo (Robson St):**
    * **Pros:** The classic Tonkotsu. The noodles are thin (Hakata-style) and you can customize everything (firmness, broth thickness, lard).
    * **Cons:** The line. Always a line.

2.  **Maruhachi (Multiple Locations):**
    * **Pros:** The chicken-based broth (Tori Paitan) is a fantastic, lighter alternative to the pork-based broths. Their A-Buri (torched) chashu is incredible.
    * **Cons:** Less traditional, if that's what you're looking for.

### Worth a Visit

* **Hokkaido Ramen Santouka (Robson St):** A legend. Their Toroniku (pork cheek) is famously tender. The broth is milder than Danbo's.
* **JINYA Ramen (Downtown):** A solid choice, more of a "modern" ramen bar feel. Their Spicy Chicken Ramen is excellent.
