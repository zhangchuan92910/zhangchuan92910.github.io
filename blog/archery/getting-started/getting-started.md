# Getting Started with Recurve Archery

I picked up recurve archery as a hobby, and it has quickly become a meditative practice for me. It's a sport of pure consistency and process.

If you're looking to start, here's my advice:

* **Don't Buy a Bow:** Go to a local club and use their rental equipment. Your "draw weight" (how hard it is to pull the string) will increase quickly in the first few months, and you don't want to be stuck with a bow that's too weak.
* **Focus on Form, Not Aim:** Your first 1,000 arrows shouldn't even involve a target. Shoot at a blank bale from 5-10 meters away. The only goal is to make every shot feel *exactly* the same.
* **It's 90% Mental:** Once your form is set, the only thing that makes an arrow miss is your own mind.
